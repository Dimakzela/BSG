/// INSTRUCTIONS:
/// Write the logic within the Anagram Service class to determine how many anagrams exist in a given list of words.
/// The definition of an anagram can be found here: https://www.google.co.za/?#q=definition+of+anagram
///
/// The output should list how many anagrams exist for a given character count.
/// E.g. Words with the character length of 4 had 5000 anagrams
///
/// Feel free to change the structure of the solution if you feel it helps optimise execution speed, memory usage etc.
/// Feel free to ask other colleagues and / or use google when crafting your solution.
/// Document assumptions (if any) as comments in code.
///
/// Your code should:
///     a) make use of the included file Dictionary.txt,
///     b) write your results to the console in the form "Words with the character length of x had y anagrams"
///     c) include the total time in milliseconds somewhere in your console output
///     d) not write to the console on processing each word
///
/// Should BSG proceed with a follow-up interview, you will be required to walk through your code as part of the face to face interview process.
///
/// Press return the completed solution with 48 hours to BSG, using the same email address that you received the zipped package.
/// Please re-zip your solution excluding all unnecessary files (e.g. *.user, *.suo, bin folder, obj folder)
